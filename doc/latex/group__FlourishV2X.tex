\subsection{Detailed Description}
Copyright T\+SS 2017

The framework (based on \hyperlink{classV2XFramework}{V2\+X\+Framework}) aims to provide a platform to simulate communications between vehicles and between vehicles and stations. In the following, we will refer to \char`\"{}core\char`\"{} as everything inside Aimsun simulator, keeping a distinction between what is going on in this plugin and inside Aimsun.

In the framework we have two main objects\+: a \hyperlink{classFlourishConnectedAgent}{Flourish\+Connected\+Agent}, which represents a vehicle, and \hyperlink{classFlourishAP}{Flourish\+AP}, which represents a static infrastructure. To enable V2V communication, each vehicle has internally a station. This means that a \hyperlink{classFlourishConnectedAgent}{Flourish\+Connected\+Agent} can be seen as a moving station. Therefore, we can say that the main components of the framework are mobile stations (\hyperlink{classFlourishConnectedAgent}{Flourish\+Connected\+Agent}) and fixed stations (\hyperlink{classFlourishAP}{Flourish\+AP}).

Visually, in the Aimsun simulator, two main attributes are added to vehicles and access point\+: delay and error\+\_\+rate. Delay (in seconds) is the propagation delay of the associated channel; error\+\_\+rate is, instead, the probability of losing a packet, expressed in \%.

They can be changed through the associated type (e.\+g., for access point right click on the access point, and then go to \char`\"{}\+Attribute\char`\"{} tab, for Vehicles go in Demand Data -\/ Vehicle -\/ and then right click on the vehicle class, and then go to \char`\"{}\+Attribute\char`\"{} tab).

To learn about the internals, look at the documentation of the \hyperlink{classFlourishV2XFramework}{Flourish\+V2\+X\+Framework} class.
